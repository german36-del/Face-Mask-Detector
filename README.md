# Face Mask Detector

Repository to try some computer vision techniques in python and learn about this world.

## Idea of the project
This projects aim to tackle an actual problem with the pandemy, the masks. It aims to make a computer vision solution to detect people without and with mask, as well as if the mask is correctly worn.
In order to accomplish this task some classic computer vision approaches are taken in addition to a convolutional neural network.
